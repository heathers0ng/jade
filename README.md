Using Jade
=====

To run the server, simply type into your terminal:
```
python internal/server.py
```

You MUST be located in the ROOT of the jade folder, and run the above python command exactly as written.

**Tips on How to Use the Terminal**
- if you have never used the terminal on your computer, read [this section of UnderTheCovers](https://cs-210-infrastructure.github.io/UndertheCovers/lecturenotes/unix/L02.html#navigating-and-working-with-the-file-system).
- use `pwd` to check your current location, (before running jade, you should see the path of your jade folder, like `/home/annaad/Documents/bu/cs210/jade`)
- if you are in the wrong location, type `ls` to see all folders and files in your current directory
- type `cd` to change directory. for example, type `cd Documents` to go from `/home/annaad/` to `/home/annaad/Documents`
    - you can also type an absolute path like `cd /home/annaad/Documents/bu/cs210/jade` to navigate to the jade folder in one command

If you have python3 on your machine, run:
```
python3 internal/server.py
```


Python 3.13
=====
If you have the latest version of python, you will need to install the legacy-cgi python package.

```
pip install legacy-cgi
```
You may also need to type `pip3` instead of `pip` depending on your system.

If you are unfamiliar with pip, try the provided solution below.
(This only works on MAC or Linux)

Since python3.13, the following Makefile support was added (for the cgi package).
Run as follows:
- `make setup-py3` : upon installation of jade
- `make run-py3` : to start up the jade server

Complete Instructions
=====

The Jade schematic entry and simulation tool is a work in progress,
but you're welcome to experiment!

Jade can be used either standalone or as embedded courseware in the
edX framework.  To use Jade locally in standalone mode, grab the jade.zip
file, unzip it on your machine, change to the directory with the jade
files and run

    python internal/server.py

to start a basic HTTP server listening on port localhost:8000.
You can access Jade at

    http://localhost:8000/jade.html

In the standalone version of Jade, changes are saved to the local
server as they're made.  The saved state is for the particular .html
file you accessed, so if you have several .html files for, say,
different projects, their state will be stored separately.  Next time
you browse to the URL above, you'll be able to pick up your design
where you left off.

Jade can be configured to display only certain simulation tools and
parts.  The default configuration in jade_standalone.html shows all
available tools and parts libraries.  You can also load parts libraries
specific to an assignment, with schematics, icons and (read-only) tests
that serve as template and test jig for a design problem.
